# No Clutter - YouTube

This is a Firefox addon that removes YouTube's intrusive info boxes. These boxes are annoying because they push down the video's title and its buttons. I do not like scrolling past the same box over and over, and YouTube does not have its own setting to turn them off. I also do not appreciate their attempts to push " *approved* " information.

## Examples
![Flat earth box.](github/eg1.png)  
  
!['Rona box.](github/eg2.png)
## Current Issues
1. Sometimes the boxes still show up in search results; refreshing the page makes them go away. I think youtube may be doing something weird with how it moves between pages on the site.
2. The extension needs the "tabs" permission to function, even though it has host permission for youtube pages.
